# Basic Problems

## Problems 1 to 4

Please see Solutions_01_to_04.pdf for the algebraic and numerical computation of the algorithms on Slides 19 and 21.

## Problem 5

The algebraic verification of Slide 29 is attached as Solutions_05.pdf.

## Problem 6

Solutions_06.pdf shows the verification of the answers shown on slide 30.  There are only two solutions because two solutions share the same energy.  This is because setting one Qubit to 0 or 1 forces the others to a unique configuration.

## Problem 7

We were able to run the program two_same.py in the Leap IDE without issues and attach a screen shot of the same as Solutions_07.pdf.

## Problem 8 

The algebra in slide 40 is worked out in Solutions_08.pdf.

## Problem 9
